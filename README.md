# Python Script to Deploy Uniswap V2 into Phalcon Fork

## Phalcon Fork

[Phalcon Fork](https://phalcon.xyz/fork) is a specialized tool designed for Web3 developers and security researchers to conduct collaborative testing with private mainnet states. It allows users to create a Fork from any mainnet state and send transactions to the Fork via an [RPC endpoint](https://docs.blocksec.com/phalcon-fork/user-manual/fork-rpc). This innovative tool has two key features that set it apart from other platforms.

* Firstly, it offers the ability to browse all transactions and, more crucially, debug them using the [Phalcon Explorer](https://docs.blocksec.com/phalcon-explorer). 

* Secondly, it boasts an internal block browser named [Phalcon Scan](https://docs.blocksec.com/phalcon-fork/user-manual/fork-panel#scan), akin to Etherscan, facilitating easier viewing of transactions and accounts within the Fork.
